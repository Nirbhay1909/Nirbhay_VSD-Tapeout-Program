## 📖 About the Program
The **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** by **VLSI System Design (VSD)** is India’s largest collaborative silicon design initiative.  
In this program, we learn to design a **System-on-Chip (SoC)** from **RTL → GDSII** using only **open-source EDA tools**.  

> 🏆 More than **3500+ participants** are contributing to building the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem through this program.  

This initiative is organized **in collaboration with IIT Gandhinagar**.  
- 🎓 The **Top 50 students** will get an exclusive opportunity to:  
  - Work under **IIT Gandhinagar professors**.  
  - Gain hands-on access to **Synopsys industry-grade tools**.
